# Milestone1to3 (Recap)

This contains some examples created during the recap of projects 1 to 3 in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). It looks at some ForEach variants and the way that Binding works with @State.
